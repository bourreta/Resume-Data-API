            <p><h4>Third Party OAuth 2.0 Authentication:</h4>
<p>This API uses Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Visit the base URL listed below to obtain a valid token. Upon making an initial request to the API with a valid token, a user account will be created automatically.</p>

<p>For most requests, the token must be included in the header as follows:
Must include authorization header with valid Google OAuth 2.0 token. Ex. Authorization: “Bearer abc123”

If one makes a GET request to a resume which has its “public” property set to true, no token is required to allow the resume to be shareable. All other requests require a valid token.</p>
